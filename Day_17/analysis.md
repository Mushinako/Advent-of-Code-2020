# [Day 17: Conway Cubes](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/17)

## Part 1

This day's problem is more about implementation instead of algorithm. I basically
used a `defaultdict` as the underlying board and implemented the game's features.

## Part 2

Essentially the same as Part 1, with small modifications for 4D.
